If you want to see the source code, please take a look at the master branch of this project.

Else you can see the result and play a game here <https://lgillard.github.io/online_unlock_demo-IHM/>

The server might be long for first requests (it's hosted by Glitch) but if after few minutes it still doesn't work dont hesitate and contact me !

If you have some advice about code, if you've found a bug feel free to create a MR or to contact me on linkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucille-gillard-4b76b2131/>
